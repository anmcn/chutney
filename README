CHUTNEY
=======

A simple portable subset of the python pickle protocol.

Chutney support serialising:
    
    None        (null)
    int
    float       (double)
    str         (8 bit clean strings)
    utf-8       (UTF-8 encoded strings)
    tuple
    dict

Unlike Python's pickle, no memoising is performed (at this time). 
Consequently, recursive structures are not detected, and multiple
references to the same structure will result in the structure being
saved in it's entirity multiple times.

A expedient mixture of pickle protocols 0, 1 and 2 are used. The choice
is determined by:
    
    1. portable encoding (so encodings that rely on python repr() are out)
    2. simple
    3. compact

This means we choose protocol 0 for floats, as protocol 1 relies on
Python machinery for platform independent encoding, and protocol 1 for
strings and unicode, as protocol 0 uses python repr().

Note also that we send python lists as tuples to keep things simple.
